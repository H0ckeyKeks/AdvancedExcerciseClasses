This is my solution to an advances exercise of the course "Complete C# Masterclass" by Denis Panjuta (Udemy). 

## The task was as follows: ##
  Create a simple C# program that:
  1.	Declares a class Person with the following:
      o	A private member variable _name of type string.
      o	A public property Name with a getter and setter to access _name.
      o	A private member variable _age of type int.
      o	A public property Age with a getter and a custom setter that only sets _age if the value is greater than 0.
  2.	Adds a constructor to Person that takes two parameters, name and age, and initializes the member variables.
  3.	Adds a method Greet that prints a greeting message including the person's name and age.
  4.	Demonstrates the use of the class in the Main method by creating an instance of Person and calling the Greet method.

**The result of execution for the default string should be:
  "Hello, my name is John and I am 30 years old."**

**I was given a few lines of code that needed to be completed:**

using System;

namespace Coding.Exercise
{
    public class Program
    {
        public static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            // TODO
        }
    }

    public class Person
    {
        // TODO
    }
}
